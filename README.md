# Currency Textfield for Material UI version 5 (MUI)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40lupus-ai%2Fmui-currency-textfield.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40lupus-ai%2Fmui-currency-textfield)

`CurrencyTextField` is a [MUI v5](https://mui.com/) [React](https://reactjs.org/) component and provides a user friendly experience while inputing currency numbers.

It works by wrapping the functionality of <a href="https://github.com/autoNumeric/autoNumeric">autonumeric</a>.

![Example of material](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LupusAI/mui-currency-textfield/master/mui-currency-field.gif)

Main features:
 * Adds thousands separator automatically.
 * Adds automatically the decimals on blur.
 * Smart input. User can only type the accepted characters depending on the current value.
 * Lots of config options...

 npm install @lupus-ai/mui-currency-textfield --save

## Forked and Continued Development

This repository is a fork of [unicef/material-ui-currency-textfield](https://github.com/unicef/material-ui-currency-textfield). The original project is no longer maintained, so we have decided to fork the repository and continue development on the project.

We have made the following major changes to the original project:

1. Updating to Material UI version 5:
Material UI version 4 is now deprecated, so we have upgraded to version 5 in order to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

2. Updating support to React 18:
We have upgraded to React 18 in order to take advantage of the latest features and improvements, as well as to ensure that our project is compatible with the latest version of React.

3. Switching from Rollup to Webpack as Bundler:
We have switched from using Rollup as our bundler to using Webpack. By switching to Webpack, we are able to take advantage of the latest features and improvements in this popular bundler, which will help to improve the performance and reliability of this project.

We plan to continue development on the project and work on these:
- decrease bundle size
- replace deprecated react lifecycle methods

We would like to credit the original authors for their work and make it clear that this project would not be possible without their efforts.

The contributions of [@sureshsevarthi](http://github.com/sureshsevarthi) laid the groundwork for what the project has become today.
